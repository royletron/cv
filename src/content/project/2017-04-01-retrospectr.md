As our team at DiffBlue grew, and became co-located across Europe, our ability to run company wide retrospectives got harder. I put together [`retrospectr`](https://retrospectr.com) as a hack-a-thon project which ended up getting continued updates and became it's own thing. It provides live multiplayer retrospective boards, where people can push cards for suggestions, update other posts and generally get involved.
