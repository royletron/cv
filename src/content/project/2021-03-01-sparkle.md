During the pandemic everyone at VentureHarbour felt the strain of not seeing each other in person. This was especially acute our lack of praise and appreciation of each other, so as part of some late night coding practice I put together [`sparkle`](https://sparkle.land). We were working with Slack apps at the time so this became an application that sits in a Slack channel and encourages people to thank each other. It also has a web application where you can see stats on who has the most sparkles rewarded and awarded, as well as some aggregation on the words people typically use to describe you. It's used constantly.
