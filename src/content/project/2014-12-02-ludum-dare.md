I participate as regularly as I am able in various game making jams and competitions including Ludum Dare - the 48hr triannual video game creation competition, and JS13k - a month to produce a game using less than 13kb of Javascript. My most notable [entry to date](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=6677) came 6th in 2011 alongside the then lesser known creator of Minecraft. I also came 6th in [last years JS13k](http://js13kgames.com/entries/dungeon-advisor)
