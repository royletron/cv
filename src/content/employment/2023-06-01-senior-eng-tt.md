The mission at TeacherTapp couldn't be more important, to provide all teachers in the UK with a voice and platform for change. My role has been to come in and lead the development of the core TeacherTapp app - which 10k teachers use daily. Technically this a React Native application for both iOS and Android and an extensive Go backend for capturing responses and parsing those into meaningful results and conclusions. As well as keeping up with BAU, I am also leading projects to tap into other areas of teacher improvement, namely CPD to date - with an events portal where teachers can find recommended learning events highly tailored to them. There is so much this app can deliver to improve the lives of every teacher, and it's very exciting to be part of that.
