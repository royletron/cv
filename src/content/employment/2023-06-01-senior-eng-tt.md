The mission at TeacherTapp couldn't be more important, to provide all teachers in the UK with a voice and platform for change. My role has been to come in and lead the development of the core TeacherTapp app - which 10k teachers use daily - including the front end React Native application and an extensive backend for capturing responses and parsing into meaningful results and conclusions. As well as keeping up with BAU, I have also lead a project to tap into other areas of teacher improvement, namely CPD - with an events portal where teachers can find recommended learning events highly tailored to them.
