Bringing order to some of the technological chaos of this small but well regarded educational business. As CTO I was responsible for securing and solidifying an existing product 'EasyRead', bringing it up to best practices and ensuring it was able to scale with continued success. Helping the existing development team mature, become more efficient in their coding practices, project management, and approach to testing. Technically I moved all new architecture to a completely containerised service architecture, using Javascript as our primary language across the team - backends in Express with MongoDB and front ends in React, as well as laying the foundations for their up-coming app in React Native.
