My first _real job_! It was a really good start to my career, giving me the chance to play with a lot of different things and decide on where to hone my skills. One highlight of this role was designing and implementing a 'digital book' product that I exclusively developed in ActionScript 3. This software eventually went on to be used in over 60 products, as well as winning an IDA Award for a product that was produced for the Indian market.
