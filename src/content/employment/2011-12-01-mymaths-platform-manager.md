After showing that I was becoming a `really solid engineer` I was made responsible for a newly aquired business - MyMaths. At the time it was the largest online educational maths platform in the UK, with close to _250k DAU_ during school term time. This role developed from integrating the service, hooking in back-office systems (SAP, CRM etc), recruiting, training and managing a new team of developers and project managers on to designing and implementing a complete rewrite of the system - which still runs today! It was also my _first real management role_ where at it's peak I managed a team of 4 full time programmers, as well a project manager and numerous contractors. MyMaths had around 5 million users, served over 9 million page views per week and was regularly in the top 500 Alexa charts(UK) whilst under my care - it was a great role.
