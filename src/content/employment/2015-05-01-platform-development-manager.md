Following my successful management of the rewrite of MyMaths I was promoted to manage development across all of the Education Divisions web platforms. This included continued support and incremental improvement for the MyMaths web service - with internationalisation and global rollout of the platform - and bringing standardised development practices (SCM, TDD, CI) for two other major web applications. I continued the management of my previous team, whilst adding new support staff and extra developers (peaking at 7 full time staff). I also oversaw the rollout of agile project management methodologies through the supporting publishing and editorial teams - which my team had `pioneered` within the company.
