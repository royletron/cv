Having seen a very short demo of the technology at Diffblue I was instantly interested, and took a role as Senior Developer. They were in transition from prototype to production - and were frantically trying to secure funding. On the back of my work in first few months we were able to take the demo through to real users which secured us our Series A of Â£17M which was a real _career highlight_. We then went into rapid growth, with me taking on more management as a Team Lead and forming the integrations team - who effectively pulled everything into the shipped product. I was responsible for a lot of the team hiring - which was close to 50 developers - and managing my own team of 8. On any given day I could be writing Typescript for one of our service API's, designing our distributed computing service on Kubernetes, or integrating our product into SCM, CI or any other service that makes sense. It was really scrappy, but an incredible experience with some super intelligent people trying to do something no-one else had achieved.
