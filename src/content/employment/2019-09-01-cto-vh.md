I joined VentureHarbour after meeting the CEO and learning about their mission to spawn new startups every year. It felt like a place where I could make real impact and after joining as `Technical Lead` I did! Within the first few months I had worked through a lot of the existing 'ventures', securing, optimising and just systemitising everything so they could all operate smoother - it was quite ramshackled prior. At the same time I was making small tactical changes to the work that had already been done to their current venture 'Serene' to make the application real-time across web and desktop. At that stage it was desktop focussed but it seemed neccesary to take the core online so we could work on team-based features - the sorts of things that make revenue. I transitioned to CTO at the start of 2022, managing the development team of 4 - as well as contractors and other support staff - and delivering 4 independant ventures. From referral sites with SEO optimisations, Slack based applications for managing team performance, to a full SaaS marketing activity planner it was a real rollercoaster of projects.
